									I am a problem solver looking for new, challenging opportunities. I am always on the lookout for innovative solutions to problems that face myself and my community. I believe in the inherent value of teams and the importance of working collaboratively to address complex challenges. I look forward to the next project I can tackle!

									I am a student at Harvard College studying <a href="http://www.gov.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Government</a>. I am a resident of <a href="http://pfoho.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Pforzheimer House</a> and a member of the <a href="http://www.iop.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University Institute of Politics</a> (IOP), where I serve on the Student Advisory Council. At the IOP, I led the Policy Program–the largest IOP program by membership. I administrated the production of <a href="http://www.iop.harvard.edu/PolicyGroups" target="_blank">multiple policy briefs</a> commissioned by the Massachusetts State Senate on topics ranging from education reform to medical device regulation. I am pursuing a secondary (minor) in Computer Science, and am proficient in multiple programming languages. I have worked in C, Python, PHP, and SQL, as well as HTML5 &amp; JavaScript. I am currently enrolled in Computer Science 109, <a href="http://www.cs109.org" target="_blank">Data Science</a>, which focuses on data management, analysis, and prediction. I believe data science has the ability to revolutionize the way we address complex business issues and bring order to the vast amounts of data that are being generated by businesses and the government.<br><br>

									I recently finished serving the communities of Bridgewater and Raynham, Massachusetts as an elected member of the <a href="http://bridge-rayn.org" target="_blank">Bridgewater-Raynham Regional School Committee</a>. I was elected to a three-year term in 2012 at the age of 18&mdash;the youngest elected official in either town’s history. Serving my community was an honor for me, as it provided the opportunity to lend my time and effort to improve the school district that was so influential in contributing to my personal development.<br><br>

									During the summer of 2015, I was a fellow at Harvard Business School in the <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/primo/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Program for Research in Markets and Organizations</a> (PRIMO). As a PRIMO fellow, I drafted an article on corporate governance at wholly owned subsidiary corporations. I am a former White House Associate, where I worked in the Office of Presidential Correspondence (OPC). At Harvard University, I assist English language learners improve their skills and become more comfortable in conversational settings at the <a href="http://bokcenter.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Bok Center for Teaching and Learning</a>. I also work as a Student Software Developer for <a href="http://huit.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University Information Technology</a> working with the <a href="http://tlt.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Teaching &amp; Learning Technologies</a> devision. During the fall 2015 semester, I work as a course assistant at the Kennedy School of Government, where I hold office hours, grade problem sets, and manage classroom logistics for graduate students in the course API-105, "Markets and Market Failures with Cases."<br><br>

									I am an Eagle Scout and maintain membership with the Boy Scouts of America as a Troop Committee Member in my home troop. I enjoy the outdoors, camping, hiking, and exploring.

    								My Photography

    							<img src="/includes/img/photos/91.jpg" class="alignright" width="365" alt="Spruce"/>
    							<p style="text-align: justify">
    								I spent the summer of 2013 working at the <a href="http://www.doaks.org/"  target="_blank">Dumbarton Oaks Research Library</a> in Washington, DC, which was <a href="http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/gardens/#page=2" target="_blank">recognized by National Geographic</a> as having one of the best public gardens in the world. After spending a few weeks in the gardens, I decided to take up photography to document the beauty that I saw. Since then, my interest has grown and I strive to improve my skills as a photographer and capture meaningful moments in my life.<br><br>

									I am a freelance photographer for <a href="http://cs50.smugmug.com" target="_blank">CS50</a>, and also do work for student groups and Harvard students. I welcome new opportunities to do event photography or portraiture for individuals in the Harvard community or greater-Cambridge area. I currently shoot on a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/nikond700/pool/" target="_blank">Nikon D700</a> and primarily use a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/n85f18g/pool/" target="_blank">85mm f/1.8</a> Nikkor prime lens.
