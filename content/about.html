  I am a graduate of Harvard College where I studied

    Science</a>. I was a resident of
  <a href="https://pfoho.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Pforzheimer House</a>. I

  I work primarily in Python and SQL, but have also have worked in
  HTML5, JavaScript, PHP, and C. My interests within the field of
  computer science are data science and data visualization. When used
  in combination, data science and visualization make big data more
  accessible. They allow policymakers, practitioners, and the public
  to identify important trends and takeaways that would otherwise be
  obscured by noisy data.

<h3>Education and Experience</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  While at Harvard, I was a member of the
  <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Harvard University Institute of
    Politics</a>
  (IOP), where I served on the Student Advisory Council. At the IOP, I
  led the Policy Program–the largest IOP program by membership. I
  administrated the production of
  <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/get-involved/policy-program" target="_blank"
    style="text-decoration: underline;">multiple policy briefs</a>
  commissioned by the Massachusetts State Senate on topics ranging
  from education reform to medical device regulation.<br /><br />

  In 2015, I finished a three-year term serving the communities of
  Bridgewater and Raynham, Massachusetts as an elected member of the
  <a href="http://bridge-rayn.org" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Bridgewater-Raynham Regional
    School Committee</a>. I was elected at
  the age of 18&mdash;the youngest elected
  official in either town’s history.<br /><br />

  During the summer of 2015, I was a fellow at Harvard Business School
  in the
  <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/primo/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Program for Research in Markets and
    Organizations</a>
  (PRIMO). As a PRIMO fellow, I drafted an article on corporate
  governance at wholly owned subsidiary corporations. I am also a
  former White House Associate, where I worked in the Office of
  Presidential Correspondence (OPC).<br /><br />

  As an undergraduate, I helped English language learners improve
  their skills and become more comfortable in conversational settings
  at the
  <a href="https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Bok Center for Teaching and Learning</a>. I also worked as
  a Student Software Developer for
  <a href="https://huit.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University Information Technology</a>
  working with the
  <a href="https://tlt.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Teaching &amp; Learning Technologies</a>
  devision.<br /><br />

  I am an Eagle Scout and maintain membership with the Boy Scouts of
  America as a Troop Committee Member in my home troop. I enjoy the
  outdoors, camping, hiking, and exploring.

<h3>My Photography</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  I spent the summer of 2013 working at the
  <a href="https://www.doaks.org/" target="_blank">Dumbarton Oaks Research Library</a>
  in Washington, DC, which was
  <a href="https://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/gardens/#page=2" target="_blank">recognized by National
    Geographic</a>
  as having one of the best public gardens in the world. Spending time
  in the gardens inspired me to take up photography. Since then, my
  interest has grown and I strive to improve my skills as a
  photographer and capture meaningful moments in my life.<br /><br />

  I have worked as a freelance photographer for
  <a href="https://cs50.smugmug.com" target="_blank">CS50</a>, and
  also do work for student groups and Harvard students. I welcome new
  opportunities to do event photography or portraiture for individuals
  in the Harvard community or Boston area.<br /><br />
